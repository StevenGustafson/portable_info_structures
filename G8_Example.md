# 📘 Investopedia Definition Extractor
## 📘 About
This system is a web-based tool designed to extract financial term definitions from
Investopedia given any user-provided paragraph (up to 100 words). It targets
students, analysts, or non-experts who need to quickly understand terminology
embedded in financial writing. The audience includes those in business
intelligence, finance education, or financial technology. The application is
accessed via a simple React frontend that connects to a Flask-based API running
locally or remotely.
---
## 📘 Methodology
- The input paragraph is parsed and cleaned using Python NLP techniques.
- It tokenizes the paragraph into single words, bigrams, and trigrams to detect
potential financial terms.
- Each term candidate is checked for a valid Investopedia definition using URL-
based scraping.
- The system first attempts to retrieve definitions via
`https://www.investopedia.com/terms/{first-letter}/{slug}.asp`.
- If the direct path fails, it falls back to searching the term on DuckDuckGo
restricted to Investopedia.
- Definitions are parsed using BeautifulSoup from tags like `<p id="mntl-sc-
block_2-0">` and `<div id="short-definition__text_1-0">`.
- Only terms that return a valid definition and URL are included in the output.
- The API supports a PUT request to update the input and a GET request to retrieve
definitions.
- Cross-origin requests from the frontend are handled using `flask-cors`.

## 📘 Access
- **Frontend**: Start the React application (e.g., `npm start`) which runs at
`http://localhost:3000`.
- **Backend**: Start the Flask API (e.g., `python app.py`) which runs at
`http://localhost:5050`.
- **Input**:
- Use the frontend interface to paste or type your paragraph.
- On submission, the React app sends a `PUT` request to `/input`.
- **Processing**:
- Flask saves the paragraph to `input.txt`, extracts terms, and scrapes
Investopedia definitions.
- **Output**:
- React calls `GET /definitions` to fetch a JSON array of matching terms with
definitions and URLs.
- Ensure both servers are running simultaneously and that `flask-cors` is enabled
for communication.

## Structure
Each definition is returned as an object in a JSON array with the following schema:
| Field | Type | Description
|
-|
|
|
|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------
| `term` | string | The financial term or phrase detected in the paragraph
| `definition`| string | A brief definition pulled from Investopedia
| `url` | string | Direct link to the Investopedia article for further
